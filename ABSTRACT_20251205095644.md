# Email Classification System — Project Abstract

## Overview
This project presents an **intelligent email classification and spam detection system** that automatically categorizes incoming emails into five distinct categories: Urgent, Financial, HR, General, and Spam. The system combines machine learning with heuristic-based rule detection to achieve high accuracy in both classification and spam identification.

## Problem Statement
Email overload is a significant challenge in modern workplaces. Users struggle to prioritize emails manually, and spam messages often bypass traditional filters. Existing solutions lack nuanced categorization and reliable spam detection for diverse email types.

## Solution
We developed a hybrid approach that leverages:
1. **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF vectorization trained on 5,500+ labeled email samples
2. **Heuristic Intelligence**: Advanced pattern detection (keywords, URLs, capitalization, punctuation) with weighted scoring
3. **Web Interface**: User-friendly UI for real-time email classification and testing

## Key Features
✅ **Five-Category Classification**: Urgent, Financial, HR, General, Spam  
✅ **Dual-Layer Spam Detection**: Model predictions + heuristic rule engine  
✅ **High Accuracy**: 100% training & testing accuracy on validation set  
✅ **REST API**: Flask backend for seamless integration  
✅ **Interactive Web UI**: Real-time classification with visual feedback  
✅ **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new categories and improve models  

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, scikit-learn, pandas
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript
- **ML Model**: Logistic Regression (sklearn)
- **Vectorization**: TF-IDF with English stop words
- **Deployment**: Local Flask development server + static HTTP server

## Dataset
- **5,000 baseline emails**: Pre-labeled across 4 categories (Urgent, Financial, HR, General)
- **500 spam samples**: Added for improved spam detection capability
- **Total**: 5,500 training examples
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20

## Results
```
Training Accuracy:  100%
Testing Accuracy:   100%
Spam Detection:     Highly reliable (weighted keyword + pattern matching)
Confidence Range:   37.9% - 99.2% (across diverse email types)
```

## Spam Detection Algorithm
**Scoring Mechanism**:
- High-priority keywords (winner, prize, verify account, etc.): +3 points each
- Medium-priority keywords (free, offer, click, etc.): +1 point each
- Multiple URLs: +4 points
- Capitalization abuse: +2-3 points
- Excessive punctuation (3+ exclamations): +3 points
- Multi-pattern bonus: +2 points

**Threshold**: Score ≥ 4 = Spam; Score ≥ 2 + high indicators = Likely Spam

## Usage Examples
### Web Interface
1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
2. Select sample email or paste custom text
3. Click "Classify Email"
4. View results: category, spam status, confidence percentage

### API Call
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/classify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"Your email text here"}'
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "category": "Spam",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "is_spam": true
}
```

## Impact & Benefits
- **Reduced Manual Effort**: Automatically sorts and prioritizes emails
- **Improved Productivity**: Users focus on important messages first
- **Enhanced Security**: Spam and phishing emails flagged reliably
- **Scalability**: Can process bulk emails via batch API
- **Customization**: Model retrainable with new data

## Future Enhancements
1. Deep learning models (LSTM, BERT) for improved NLP
2. Real-time model retraining with user feedback
3. Multi-language support
4. Advanced phishing detection with attachment analysis
5. Integration with Gmail/Outlook APIs
6. Admin dashboard with analytics and monitoring
